	abstract={ Main memory compression has re-emerged as a viable solution to DRAM cost challenges, enabled by CXL memory devices that support hardware-managed, coarse-grained compression. This shift decouples logical memory space usage from physical consumption, opening new opportunities to re-think the design and implementation of in-memory data structures. This letter presents case studies on blocked variants of chained and Cuckoo hashing that align naturally with the memory compression granularity. Targeting large-scale in-memory data stores, blocked hash tables trade logical sparsity for implementation efficiency while leveraging compression to avoid physical memory waste. We develop mathematical formulations to enable theoretical analysis of key metrics, including memory usage saving and operational throughput. Our results highlight the potential of compression-aware data structures to better leverage modern memory hierarchies and motivate further exploration in this largely untapped design space. },
